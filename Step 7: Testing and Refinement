 • Propose at least four test cases based on input combinations.
 • Record expected vs. actual outputs. 

Test 1

TA = False
TT = True
TG = True

Expected Output
The Gate should remain closed as the TT sensor still senses a train on the tracks.
Actual Output
The gate remains closed.
Test 2 

TA = True
TT = false
TG = True
Expected Output
The gate should remain closed as the TA sensor senses a new oncoming train.
Actual Output
The gate remains closed.




Test 3 

TA = True 
TT = True
TG = False

Expected Output
The gate should be closed as there is a train on the tracks and there is another train approaching.
Actual Output
The gate remains closed.

Test 4 

TA = True 
TT = True 
TG = True

Expected Output
The Gate should remain closed as there is still a train on the tracks, and another train is approaching. 
Actual Output
The gate remains Closed.

• Suggest improvements or refinements to the logic circuit.

The logic circuit is simple and adequate. The only improvements I could make are if there are extra safety features, such as warning lights, an emergency stop or if there is a sensor to detect if there is a car still on tracks.
