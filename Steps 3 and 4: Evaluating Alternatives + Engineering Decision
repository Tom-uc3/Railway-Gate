• Justify your choice based on simplicity, safety, and reliability.

Solution 1 seems more adequate for the task at hand as it is more reliable and safer with the TT sensor and is still simple. As if the TG sensor fails, there is still the TT sensor as backup to keep the gate closed or if there is a shorter train it won’t be on both sensors at the same time to keep the gate closed.
Although Solution 2 is simpler and more cost-effective, it isn’t as safe.
